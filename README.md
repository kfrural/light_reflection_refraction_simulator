# Light Reflection and Refraction Simulator

An interactive Python-based simulator for visualizing light reflection and refraction phenomena based on Geometric Optics principles.

## Overview

This project allows users to input an angle of incidence and refractive indices for two different media to calculate the angles of reflection and refraction. The simulator also determines if total internal reflection occurs.

## Features

- Calculates reflection and refraction angles using Snell's Law.
- Detects total internal reflection conditions.
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/light_reflection_refraction_simulator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd light_reflection_refraction_simulator

Install dependencies (if any are added in the future):

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run

To start the simulator, use the following command:

bash

python light_simulator/main.py
